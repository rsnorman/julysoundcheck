# JulySouncheck

## Rules
1. Every day in July you need to listen to an album by an artist you’ve never heard. This means that a review you read somewhere but you never got around to listening to is fair game.
2. After you listen to that album, write a tweet-length (160 characters or less) review of it. If you do tweet it, include #JulySoundcheck.
3. Fill out the album in the spreadsheet*
4. Use our stupid rating system in the spreadsheet**
5. Add the entire album to the playlist***
6. Every Friday is “Rec Day,” meaning you need to get a recommendation from someone else. They can be from outside of JSC, but inside is preferred. Try to challenge yourself, ask for an album for a genre you’re not familiar with.
7. There are a group of generally agreed upon “untouchable” bands. These are bands that are so prolific that it would be nearly impossible to have never heard them at some point. Artists like Beyonce, The Beach Boys, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Frank Sinatra, etc.

## Rating Scale
The scale goes from 0-3 with +/- used for nuance. 0 is unlistenable, 1 is only worth a listen, 2 is you’ll listen multiple times, 3 is essential. 3+ generally means everyone should listen, and many people do, so use wisely. 0- is reserved for an album that is physically painful, never seen yet.
